# ex-vi: My Vi GitHub Repository
This repository is dedicated to Bill Joy's ex and vi implementation.

I started using Vi on a SINIX 
([German](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinix)/[English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinix)) 
system in 1986 when I worked for the Siemens Research & Development Department in Munich.

Up to now Vi - and now Vim - is my preferred choice for file editing in Linux.

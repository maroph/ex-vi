# The Traditional Vi
Gunnar Ritter created the [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/) project
[The Traditional Vi](https://ex-vi.sourceforge.net/) with Vi 3.7 as base and
released a version 4.0 (25-MAR-2007).

Quote from Gunnar's page:

>This port of vi has generally preserved the original style, terminal control, 
>and feature set. It adds support for international character sets, including 
>multibyte encodings such as UTF-8, and some minor enhancements that were not 
>present in BSD vi 3.7, but had been included in later vi versions for System V 
>or in POSIX.2.

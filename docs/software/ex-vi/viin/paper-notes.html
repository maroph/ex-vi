is gratefully acknowledged.&nbsp;</P>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you gave the system an incorrect terminal type code then the
editor may have just made a mess out of your screen.  This happens when
it sends control codes for one kind of terminal to some other
kind of terminal. n this case hit
the keys <B>:q</B> (colon and the q key) and then hit the RETURN key.
This should get you back to the command level interpreter.
Figure out what you did wrong (ask someone else if necessary) and try again.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing
which can go wrong is that you typed the wrong file name and
the editor just printed an error diagnostic.  In this case you should
follow the above procedure for getting out of the editor, and try again
this time spelling the file name correctly.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If the editor doesn't seem
to respond to the commands which you type
here, try sending an interrupt to it by hitting the DEL or RUB
key on your terminal, and then hitting the <B>:q</B> command again followed
by a carriage return.
</P>
<H3><A NAME="1-2">1-2</A></H3>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As we will see <A HREF="paper-2.html#section12">later</A>,
<I>h
</I>moves back to the left (like control-h which is a backspace),
<I>j
</I>moves down (in the same column),
<I>k
</I>moves up (in the same column),
and
<I>l
</I>moves to the right.
</P>
<H3><A NAME="1-3">1-3</A></H3>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On smart terminals where it is possible, the editor will quietly
flash the screen rather than ringing the bell.
</P>
<H3><A NAME="1-4">1-4</A></H3>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Backspacing over the '/' will also cancel the search.
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Note: If the editor prints </I>No previous regular expression<I>
on the bottom line of the screen, the </I>DEL<I> key on your terminal
does not send the delete character </I>^?<I>, but a character
sequence starting with </I>ESC<I>.
The interrupt function is most often assigned to </I><B>^C</B><I> then
(refer to
<A HREF="paper-2.html#section10">section 2.1</A>
about the notation).
If you cannot find the appropriate key or key sequence,
type</I>
<PRE>
% <B>stty -a</B>
</PRE>
<P>
<I>at the shell command level and look for the characters
following &#147;intr&#148;.</I>
</P>
<H3><A NAME="1-5">1-5</A></H3>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On some systems, this interruptibility comes at a price: you cannot type
ahead when the editor is computing with the cursor on the bottom line.
</P>
<H3><A NAME="1-6">1-6</A></H3>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All commands which read from the last display line can also be
terminated with a ESC as well as an CR.
</P>
<H3><A NAME="2-1">2-1</A></H3>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't have a '^' key on your terminal
then there is probably a key labelled '&uarr;'; in any case these characters
are one and the same.
<I>Note: Some web browsers are unable to display an uparrow character
and show </I>&amp;uarr;<I> instead. Read this as </I>uparrow<I>.
Be aware that the </I>uparrow<I> mentioned here
is not one of the keys on the cursor keypad,
but an ancient notation for
the </I>caret<I> or </I>circumflex<I> character.</I>
</I>
</P>
<H3><A NAME="2-2">2-2</A></H3>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;These searches will normally wrap around the end of the file,
and thus
find the string even if it is not on a line in the direction you search
provided it is anywhere else in the file.  You can disable this wraparound
in scans by giving the command <B>:se nowrapscan</B>CR,
or more briefly <B>:se nows</B>CR.
</P>
<H3><A NAME="2-3">2-3</A></H3>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, the string you give to search for here can be a
<I>regular expression
</I>in the sense of the editors
<I>ex</I>(1)
and
<I>ed</I>(1).
If you don't wish to learn about this yet, you can disable this more
general facility by doing
<B>:se nomagic</B>CR;
by putting this command in
EXINIT
in your environment, you can have this always be in effect (more
about
<I>EXINIT
</I><A HREF="paper-6.html#section35">later</A>.)
</P>
<H3><A NAME="3-1">3-1</A></H3>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the character <B>^H</B> (backspace)
always works to erase the
last input character here, regardless of what your erase character is.
</P>
<H3><A NAME="3-2">3-2</A></H3>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The command <B>S</B> is a convenient synonym for for <B>cc</B>, by
analogy with <B>s</B>.  Think of <B>S</B> as a substitute on lines, while
<B>s</B> is a substitute on characters.
</P>
<H3><A NAME="3-3">3-3</A></H3>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One subtle point here involves using
the <B>/</B> search after a <B>d</B>.
This will normally delete characters from the current position to the
point of the match.  If what is desired is to delete whole lines
including the two points, give the pattern as <B>/pat/+0</B>, a line address.
</P>
<H3><A NAME="4-1">4-1</A></H3>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is settable by a command of the form <B>:se ts=</B><I>x</I>CR,
where <I>x</I> is 4 to set tabstops every four columns.  This has
effect on the screen representation within the editor.
</P>
<H3><A NAME="4-2">4-2</A></H3>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The <B>[[</B> and <B>]]</B> operations
require the operation character to be doubled because they can move the
cursor far from where it currently is.  While it is easy to get back
with the command <B>``</B>,
these commands would still be frustrating
if they were easy to hit accidentally.
</P>
<H3><A NAME="4-3">4-3</A></H3>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You can easily change or extend this set of macros by assigning a
different string to the <I>paragraphs</I> option in your EXINIT.
See <A HREF="paper-6.html#section35">section 6.2</A> for details.
The '.bp' directive is also considered to start a paragraph.
</P>
<H3><A NAME="6-1">6-1</A></H3>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that the command <B>5z.</B> has an entirely different effect,
placing line 5 in the center of a new window.
</P>
<H3><A NAME="6-2">6-2</A></H3>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All commands which start with
<B>:
</B>are <I>ex</I> commands.
</P>
<H3><A NAME="6-3">6-3</A></H3>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In rare cases, some of the lines of the file may be lost.  The
editor will give you the numbers of these lines and the text of the lines
will be replaced by the string 'LOST'.  These lines will almost always
be among the last few which you changed.  You can either choose to discard
the changes which you made (if they are easy to remake) or to replace
the few lost lines by hand.
</P>
<H3><A NAME="7-1">7-1</A></H3>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You can make long lines very easily by using <B>J</B>
to join together short lines.
</P>
<H3><A NAME="7-2">7-2</A></H3>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But not by a <B>^L</B> which just redraws the screen as it is.
</P>
<H3><A NAME="7-3">7-3</A></H3>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not quite true.  The implementation of the editor does
not allow the NULL (<B>^@</B>) character to appear in files.  Also
the LF (linefeed or <B>^J</B>) character is used by the editor
to separate lines in the file, so it cannot appear in the middle of a
line.  You can insert any other character, however, if you wait for the
editor to echo the <B>&uarr;</B> before you type the character.  In fact,
the editor will treat a following letter as a request for the corresponding
control character.  This is the only way to type <B>^S</B> or <B>^Q</B>,
since the system normally uses them to suspend and resume output
and never gives them to the editor to process.
</P>
<H3><A NAME="7-4">7-4</A></H3>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The \ character you give will not echo until you type another key.

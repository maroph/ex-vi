<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><em>Ex</em> is the root of a family of editors: <em>edit,</em> <em>ex</em> and <em>vi.</em> <em>Ex</em> is
a superset of <em>ed,</em> with the most notable extension being a display
editing facility. Display based editing on</p>
<p>terminals is the focus of <em>vi</em>.</p>
<p>For those who have not used <em>ed,</em> or for casual users, the editor <em>edit</em>
may be convenient. It avoids some of the complexities of <em>ex</em> used
mostly by systems programmers and persons very familiar with <em>ed.</em></p>
<p>The following options are accepted:</p>
<p><strong>-c</strong><em> command</em> or <strong>+</strong><em>command</em></p>
<p>:   Execute <em>command</em> when editing begins.</p>
<p><strong>-l</strong></p>
<p>:   Start in a special mode useful for the <em>Lisp</em> programming language.</p>
<p><strong>-r</strong><em> [filename]</em> or <strong>-L</strong></p>
<p>:   When no argument is supplied with this option, all files to be
    recovered are listed and the editor exits immediately. If a
    <em>filename</em> is specified, the corresponding temporary file is opened
    in recovery mode.</p>
<p><strong>-R</strong></p>
<p>:   Files are opened read-only when this option is given.</p>
<p><strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-</strong></p>
<p>:   Script mode; all feedback for interactive editing is disabled.</p>
<p>and <em>.exrc</em> files are not processed.</p>
<p><strong>-t</strong><em> tagstring</em></p>
<p>:   Read the <em>tags</em> file, then choose the file and position specified by
    <em>tagstring</em> for editing.</p>
<p><strong>-v</strong></p>
<p>:   Start in visual mode even if called as <em>ex</em>.</p>
<p><strong>-V</strong></p>
<p>:   Echo command input to standard error, unless it originates from a
    terminal.</p>
<p><strong>-w</strong><em> size</em></p>
<p>:   Specify the size of the editing window for visual mode.</p>
<h2 id="file-manipulation">File manipulation</h2>
<p><em>Ex</em> is normally editing the contents of a single file, whose name is
recorded in the <em>current</em> file name. <em>Ex</em> performs all editing actions
in a buffer (actually a temporary file) into which the text of the file
is initially read. Changes made to the buffer have no effect on the file
being edited unless and until the buffer contents are written out to the
file with a <em>write</em> command. After the buffer contents are written, the
previous contents of the written file are no longer accessible. When a
file is edited, its name becomes the current file name, and its contents
are read into the buffer.</p>
<p>The current file is almost always considered to be <em>edited.</em> This means
that the contents of the buffer are logically connected with the current
file name, so that writing the current buffer contents onto that file,
even if it exists, is a reasonable action. If the current file is not
<em>edited</em> then <em>ex</em> will not normally write on it if it already exists.</p>
<p>For saving blocks of text while editing, and especially when editing
more than one file, <em>ex</em> has a group of named buffers. These are similar
to the normal buffer, except that only a limited number of operations
are available on them. The buffers have names <em>a</em> through <em>z.</em></p>
<h2 id="exceptional-conditions">Exceptional Conditions</h2>
<p>When errors occur <em>ex</em> (optionally) rings the terminal bell and, in any
case, prints an error diagnostic. If the primary input is from a file,
editor processing will terminate. If an interrupt signal is received,
<em>ex</em> prints "Interrupt" and returns to its command level. If the primary
input is a file, then <em>ex</em> will exit when this occurs.</p>
<p>If a hangup signal is received and the buffer has been modified since it
was last written out, or if the system crashes, either the editor (in
the first case) or the system (after it reboots in the second) will
attempt to preserve the buffer. The next time the user logs in he should
be able to recover the work he was doing, losing at most a few lines of
changes from the last point before the hangup or editor crash. To
recover a file one can use the <strong>-r</strong> option. If one was editing the
file <em>resume,</em> then he should change to the directory where he were when
the crash occurred, giving the command</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ex -r</strong><em> resume</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After checking that the retrieved file is indeed ok, he can <em>write</em> it
over the previous contents of that file.</p>
<p>The user will normally get mail from the system telling him when a file
has been saved after a crash. The command</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ex</strong> -<strong>r</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>will print a list of the files which have been saved for the user.</p>
<h2 id="editing-modes">Editing modes</h2>
<p><em>Ex</em> has five distinct modes. The primary mode is <em>command</em> mode.
Commands are entered in command mode when a `:\' prompt is present, and
are executed each time a complete line is sent. In <em>text input</em> mode
<em>ex</em> gathers input lines and places them in the file. The <em>append,</em>
<em>insert,</em> and <em>change</em> commands use text input mode. No prompt is
printed when in text input mode. This mode is left by typing a `.\'
alone at the beginning of a line, and <em>command</em> mode resumes.</p>
<p>The last three modes are <em>open</em> and <em>visual</em> modes, entered by the
commands of the same name, and, within open and visual modes <em>text
insertion</em> mode. <em>Open</em> and <em>visual</em> modes allow local editing
operations to be performed on the text in the file. The <em>open</em> command
displays one line at a time on any terminal while <em>visual</em> works on</p>
<p>terminals with random positioning cursors, using the screen as a
(single) window for file editing changes. These modes are described
(only) in <em>An Introduction to Display Editing with Vi.</em></p>
<h2 id="command-structure">Command structure</h2>
<p>Most command names are English words, and initial prefixes of the words
are acceptable abbreviations. The ambiguity of abbreviations is resolved
in favor of the more commonly used commands.</p>
<p>Most commands accept prefix addresses specifying the lines in the file
upon which they are to have effect. The forms of these addresses will be
discussed below. A number of commands also may take a trailing <em>count</em>
specifying the number of lines to be involved in the command. Thus the
command "10p" will print the tenth line in the buffer while "delete 5"
will delete five lines from the buffer, starting with the current line.</p>
<p>Some commands take other information or parameters, this information
always being given after the command name.</p>
<p>A number of commands have two distinct variants. The variant form of the
command is invoked by placing an `!\' immediately after the command
name. Some of the default variants may be controlled by options; in this
case, the `!\' serves to toggle the default.</p>
<p>The characters `#\', `p\' and `l\' may be placed after many commands
(A `p\' or `l\' must be preceded by a blank or tab except in the
single special case `dp\'). In this case, the command abbreviated by
these characters is executed after the command completes. Since <em>ex</em>
normally prints the new current line after each change, `p\' is rarely
necessary. Any number of `+\' or `-\' characters may also be given
with these flags. If they appear, the specified offset is applied to the
current line value before the printing command is executed.</p>
<p>It is possible to give editor commands which are ignored. This is useful
when making complex editor scripts for which comments are desired. The
comment character is the double quote: \". Any command line beginning
with \" is ignored. Comments beginning with \" may also be placed at the
ends of commands, except in cases where they could be confused as part
of text (shell escapes and the substitute and map commands).</p>
<p>More than one command may be placed on a line by separating each pair of
commands by a `|\' character. However the <em>global</em> commands, comments,
and the shell escape `!\' must be the last command on a line, as they
are not terminated by a `|\'.</p>
<h2 id="command-addressing">Command addressing</h2>
<p>.</p>
<p>:   The current line. Most commands leave the current line as the last
    line which they affect. The default address for most commands is the
    current line, thus `<strong>.</strong>\' is rarely used alone as an address.</p>
<p>n.  The <em>n</em>th line in the editor\'s buffer, lines being numbered
    sequentially from 1.</p>
<p>\$</p>
<p>:   The last line in the buffer.</p>
<p>\%</p>
<p>:   An abbreviation for "1,\$", the entire buffer.</p>
<p>+n -n</p>
<p>:   An offset relative to the current buffer line. The forms `.+3\'
    `+3\' and `+++\' are all equivalent; if the current line is line
    100 they all address line 103.</p>
<p>/pat/ ?pat?</p>
<p>:   Scan forward and backward respectively for a line containing <em>pat</em>,
    a regular expression (as defined below). The scans normally wrap
    around the end of the buffer. If all that is desired is to print the
    next line containing <em>pat</em>, then the trailing <strong>/</strong> or <strong>?</strong> may be
    omitted. If <em>pat</em> is omitted or explicitly empty, then the last
    regular expression specified is located. The forms <strong>\/</strong> and
    <strong>\?</strong> scan using the last regular expression used in a scan; after
    a substitute <strong>//</strong> and <strong>??</strong> would scan using the substitute\'s
    regular expression.</p>
<p>´´ ´x</p>
<p>:   Before each non-relative motion of the current line `<strong>.</strong>\', the
    previous current line is marked with a tag, subsequently referred to
    as `´´\'. This makes it easy to refer or return to this previous
    context. Marks may also be established by the <em>mark</em> command, using
    single lower case letters <em>x</em> and the marked lines referred to as
    `´<em>x</em>\'.</p>
<p>Addresses to commands consist of a series of addressing primitives,
separated by `,\' or `;\'. Such address lists are evaluated
left-to-right. When addresses are separated by `;\' the current line
`<strong>.</strong>\' is set to the value of the previous addressing expression
before the next address is interpreted. If more addresses are given than
the command requires, then all but the last one or two are ignored. If
the command takes two addresses, the first addressed line must precede
the second in the buffer.</p>
<p>Null address specifications are permitted in a list of addresses, the
default in this case is the current line `.\'; thus `,100\' is
equivalent to `<strong>.</strong>,100\'. It is an error to give a prefix address to
a command which expects none.</p>
<h2 id="command-descriptions">Command descriptions</h2>
<p>The following form is a prototype for all <em>ex</em> commands:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>address</em> <strong>command</strong> <em>! parameters count flags</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All parts are optional; the degenerate case is the empty command which
prints the next line in the file. For sanity with use from within
<em>visual</em> mode, <em>ex</em> ignores a ":" preceding any command.</p>
<p>In the following command descriptions, the default addresses are shown
in parentheses, which are <em>not,</em> however, part of the command.</p>
<p><strong>abbreviate</strong> <em>word rhs</em> abbr: <strong>ab</strong></p>
<p>:   Add the named abbreviation to the current list. When in input mode
    in visual, if <em>word</em> is typed as a complete word, it will be changed
    to <em>rhs .</em></p>
<p>( <strong>.</strong> ) <strong>append</strong> abbr: <strong>a</strong>\
<em>text</em>\
<strong>.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reads the input text and places it after the specified line. After the
command, `<strong>.</strong>\' addresses the last line input or the specified line
if no lines were input. If address `0\' is given, text is placed at
the beginning of the buffer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>a!</strong>\
<em>text</em>\
<strong>.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The variant flag to <em>append</em> toggles the setting for the <em>autoindent</em>
option during the input of <em>text.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>args</strong></p>
<p>:   The members of the argument list are printed, with the current
    argument delimited by `[\' and `]\'.</p>
<p><strong>cd</strong> <em>directory</em></p>
<p>:   The <em>cd</em> command is a synonym for <em>chdir.</em></p>
<p>( <strong>.</strong> , <strong>.</strong> ) <strong>change</strong> <em>count</em> abbr: <strong>c</strong>\
<em>text</em>\
<strong>.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Replaces the specified lines with the input <em>text</em>. The current line
becomes the last line input; if no lines were input it is left as for
a <em>delete</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>c!</strong>\
<em>text</em>\
<strong>.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The variant toggles <em>autoindent</em> during the <em>change.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>chdir</strong> <em>directory</em></p>
<p>:   The specified <em>directory</em> becomes the current directory. If no
    directory is specified, the current value of the <em>home</em> option is
    used as the target directory. After a <em>chdir</em> the current file is
    not considered to have been edited so that write restrictions on
    pre-existing files apply.</p>
<p>( <strong>.</strong> , <strong>.</strong> ) <strong>copy</strong> <em>addr</em> <em>flags</em> abbr: <strong>co</strong></p>
<p>:   A <em>copy</em> of the specified lines is placed after <em>addr,</em> which may be
    `0\'. The current line `<strong>.</strong>\' addresses the last line of the
    copy. The command <em>t</em> is a synonym for <em>copy.</em></p>
<p>( <strong>.</strong> , <strong>.</strong> ) <strong>delete</strong> <em>buffer</em> <em>count</em> <em>flags</em> abbr: <strong>d</strong></p>
<p>:   Removes the specified lines from the buffer. The line after the last
    line deleted becomes the current line; if the lines deleted were
    originally at the end, the new last line becomes the current line.
    If a named <em>buffer</em> is specified by giving a letter, then the
    specified lines are saved in that buffer, or appended to it if an
    upper case letter is used.</p>
<p><strong>edit</strong> <em>file</em> abbr: <strong>e</strong>\
<strong>ex</strong> <em>file</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Used to begin an editing session on a new file. The editor first
checks to see if the buffer has been modified since the last <em>write</em>
command was issued. If it has been, a warning is issued and the
command is aborted. The command otherwise deletes the entire contents
of the editor buffer, makes the named file the current file and prints
the new filename. After insuring that this file is sensible (i.e.,
that it is not a binary file such as a directory, a block or character
special file other than <em>/dev/tty,</em> a terminal, or a binary or
executable file), the editor reads the file into its buffer.</p>
<p>If the read of the file completes without error, the number of lines
and characters read is typed. Any null characters in the file are
discarded. If none of these errors occurred, the file is considered
<em>edited.</em> If the last line of the input file is missing the trailing
newline character, it will be supplied and a complaint will be issued.
This command leaves the current line `<strong>.</strong>\' at the last line read.
If executed from within <em>open</em> or <em>visual,</em> the current line is
initially the first line of the file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>e!</strong> <em>file</em></p>
<p>:   The variant form suppresses the complaint about modifications having
    been made and not written from the editor buffer, thus discarding
    all changes which have been made before editing the new file.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong> <strong>+</strong><em>n</em> <em>file</em></p>
<p>:   Causes the editor to begin at line <em>n</em> rather than at the last line;
    <em>n</em> may also be an editor command containing no spaces, e.g.:
    "+/pat".</p>
<p><strong>file</strong> abbr: <strong>f</strong></p>
<p>:   Prints the current file name, whether it has been `[Modified]\'
    since the last <em>write</em> command, whether it is <em>read only ,</em> the
    current line, the number of lines in the buffer, and the percentage
    of the way through the buffer of the current line. In the rare case
    that the current file is `[Not edited]\' this is noted also; in
    this case one has to use the form <strong>w!</strong> to write to the file, since
    the editor is not sure that a <strong>write</strong> will not destroy a file
    unrelated to the current contents of the buffer.</p>
<p><strong>file</strong> <em>file</em></p>
<p>:   The current file name is changed to <em>file</em> which is considered
    `[Not edited]\'.</p>
<p>( 1 , \$ ) <strong>global</strong> /<em>pat </em>/ <em>cmds</em> abbr: <strong>g</strong></p>
<p>:   First marks each line among those specified which matches the given
    regular expression. Then the given command list is executed with
    `<strong>.</strong>\' initially set to each marked line.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>The command list consists of the remaining commands on the current
input line and may continue to multiple lines by ending all but the
last such line with a \`\\\&#39;. If *cmds* (and possibly the trailing
**/** delimiter) is omitted, each line matching *pat* is printed.
*Append,* *insert,* and *change* commands and associated input are
permitted; the \`**.**\&#39; terminating input may be omitted if it
would be on the last line of the command list. *Open* and *visual*
commands are permitted in the command list and take input from the
terminal.

The *global* command itself may not appear in *cmds.* The *undo*
command is also not permitted there, as *undo* instead can be used
to reverse the entire *global* command. The options *autoprint* and
*autoindent* are inhibited during a *global,* (and possibly the
trailing **/** delimiter) and the value of the *report* option is
temporarily infinite, in deference to a *report* for the entire
global. Finally, the context mark \`\&#39;\&#39;\&#39; is set to the value of
\`.\&#39; before the global command begins and is not changed during a
global command, except perhaps by an *open* or *visual* within the
*global.*

<p><strong>g!</strong> <strong>/</strong><em>pat</em><strong>/</strong> <em>cmds</em> abbr: <strong>v</strong></p>

<p>( <strong>.</strong> ) <strong>insert</strong> abbr: <strong>i</strong>\
<em>text</em>\
<strong>.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Places the given text before the specified line. The current line is
left at the last line input; if there were none input it is left at
the line before the addressed line. This command differs from <em>append</em>
only in the placement of text.</p>

<p>( <strong>.</strong> , <strong>.</strong>+1 ) <strong>join</strong> <em>count</em> <em>flags</em> abbr: <strong>j</strong></p>
<p>:   Places the text from a specified range of lines together on one
    line. White space is adjusted at each junction to provide at least
    one blank character, two if there was a `<strong>.</strong>\' at the end of the
    line, or none if the first following character is a `)\'. If there
    is already white space at the end of the line, then the white space
    at the start of the next line will be discarded.</p>
<p><strong>j!</strong></p>
<p>:   The variant causes a simpler <em>join</em> with no white space processing;
    the characters in the lines are simply concatenated.</p>
<p>( <strong>.</strong> ) <strong>k</strong> <em>x</em></p>
<p>:   The <em>k</em> command is a synonym for <em>mark.</em> It does not require a blank
    or tab before the following letter.</p>
<p>( <strong>.</strong> , <strong>.</strong> ) <strong>list</strong> <em>count</em> <em>flags</em></p>
<p>:   Prints the specified lines in a more unambiguous way: tabs are
    printed as `\^I\' and the end of each line is marked with a
    trailing `\$\'. The current line is left at the last line printed.</p>
<p><strong>map</strong>[<strong>!</strong>] <em>lhs</em> <em>rhs</em></p>
<p>:   The <em>map</em> command is used to define macros for use in <em>visual</em>
    command mode. <em>Lhs</em> should be a single character, or the sequence
    "#n", for n a digit, referring to function key <em>n</em>. When this
    character or function key is typed in <em>visual</em> mode, it will be as
    though the corresponding <em>rhs</em> had been typed. On terminals without
    function keys, the user can type "#n". If the `<strong>!</strong>\' character
    follows the command name, the mapping is interpreted in input mode.
    See section 6.9 of the "Introduction to Display Editing with Vi" for
    more details.</p>
<p>( <strong>.</strong> ) <strong>mark</strong> <em>x</em></p>
<p>:   Gives the specified line mark <em>x,</em> a single lower case letter. The
    <em>x</em> must be preceded by a blank or a tab. The addressing form
    `\'x\' then addresses this line. The current line is not affected
    by this command.</p>
<p>( <strong>.</strong> , <strong>.</strong> ) <strong>move</strong> <em>addr</em> abbr: <strong>m</strong></p>
<p>:   The <em>move</em> command repositions the specified lines to be after <em>addr
    .</em> The first of the moved lines becomes the current line.</p>
<p><strong>next</strong> abbr: <strong>n</strong></p>
<p>:   The next file from the command line argument list is edited.</p>
<p><strong>n!</strong></p>
<p>:   The variant suppresses warnings about the modifications to the
    buffer not having been written out, discarding (irretrievably) any
    changes which may have been made.</p>
<p><strong>n</strong> <em>filelist</em>\
<strong>n</strong> <strong>+</strong><em>command</em> <em>filelist</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The specified <em>filelist</em> is expanded and the resulting list replaces
the current argument list; the first file in the new list is then
edited. If <em>command</em> is given (it must contain no spaces), then it is
executed after editing the first such file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>( <strong>.</strong> , <strong>.</strong> ) <strong>number</strong> <em>count</em> <em>flags</em> abbr: <strong>#</strong> or <strong>nu</strong></p>
<p>:   Prints each specified line preceded by its buffer line number. The
    current line is left at the last line printed.</p>
<p>( <strong>.</strong> ) <strong>open</strong> <em>flags</em> abbr: <strong>o</strong>\
( <strong>.</strong> ) <strong>open</strong> /<em>pat </em>/ <em>flags</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enters intraline editing <em>open</em> mode at each addressed line. If <em>pat</em>
is given, then the cursor will be placed initially at the beginning of
the string matched by the pattern. To exit this mode use Q. See <em>An
Introduction to Display Editing with Vi</em> for more details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>preserve</strong></p>
<p>:   The current editor buffer is saved as though the system had just
    crashed. This command is for use only in emergencies when a <em>write</em>
    command has resulted in an error.</p>
<p>( <strong>.</strong> , <strong>.</strong> ) <strong>print</strong> <em>count</em> abbr: <strong>p</strong> or <strong>P</strong></p>
<p>:   Prints the specified lines with non-printing characters printed as
    control characters `\^<em>x</em> \'; delete (octal 177) is represented as
    `\^?\'. The current line is left at the last line printed.</p>
<p>( <strong>.</strong> ) <strong>put</strong> <em>buffer</em> abbr: <strong>pu</strong></p>
<p>:   Puts back previously <em>deleted</em> or <em>yanked</em> lines. Normally used with
    <em>delete</em> to effect movement of lines, or with <em>yank</em> to effect
    duplication of lines. If no <em>buffer</em> is specified, then the last
    <em>deleted</em> or <em>yanked</em> text is restored. But no modifying commands
    may intervene between the <em>delete</em> or <em>yank</em> and the <em>put,</em> nor may
    lines be moved between files without using a named buffer. By using
    a named buffer, text may be restored that was saved there at any
    previous time.</p>
<p><strong>quit</strong> abbr: <strong>q</strong></p>
<p>:   Causes <em>ex</em> to terminate. No automatic write of the editor buffer to
    a file is performed. However, <em>ex</em> issues a warning message if the
    file has changed since the last <em>write</em> command was issued, and does
    not <em>quit.</em> <em>Ex</em> will also issue a diagnostic if there are more
    files in the argument list.</p>
<p>Normally, the user will wish to save his changes, and he should give a
<em>write</em> command; if he wishes to discard them, he should the <strong>q!</strong>
command variant.</p>
<p><strong>q!</strong></p>
<p>:   Quits from the editor, discarding changes to the buffer without
    complaint.</p>
<p>( <strong>.</strong> ) <strong>read</strong> <em>file</em> abbr: <strong>r</strong></p>
<p>:   Places a copy of the text of the given file in the editing buffer
    after the specified line. If no <em>file</em> is given the current file
    name is used. The current file name is not changed unless there is
    none in which case <em>file</em> becomes the current name. The sensibility
    restrictions for the <em>edit</em> command apply here also. If the file
    buffer is empty and there is no current name then <em>ex</em> treats this
    as an <em>edit</em> command.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Address \`0\&#39; is legal for this command and causes the file to be
read at the beginning of the buffer. Statistics are given as for the
*edit* command when the *read* successfully terminates. After a
*read* the current line is the last line read. Within *open* and
*visual* the current line is set to the first line read rather than
the last.
</code></pre></div>
<p>( <strong>.</strong> ) <strong>read</strong> <strong>!</strong><em>command</em></p>
<p>:   Reads the output of the command <em>command</em> into the buffer after the
    specified line. This is not a variant form of the command, rather a
    read specifying a <em>command</em> rather than a <em>filename;</em> a blank or tab
    before the <strong>!</strong> is mandatory.</p>
<p><strong>recover </strong><em>file</em></p>
<p>:   Recovers <em>file</em> from the system save area. Used after a accidental
    hangup of the phone or a system crash or <em>preserve</em> command. Except
    when <em>preserve</em> is used, the user will be notified by mail when a
    file is saved.</p>
<p><strong>rewind</strong> abbr: <strong>rew</strong></p>
<p>:   The argument list is rewound, and the first file in the list is
    edited.</p>
<p><strong>rew!</strong></p>
<p>:   Rewinds the argument list discarding any changes made to the current
    buffer.</p>
<p><strong>set</strong> <em>parameter</em></p>
<p>:   With no arguments, prints those options whose values have been
    changed from their defaults; with parameter <em>all</em> it prints all of
    the option values.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Giving an option name followed by a \`?\&#39; causes the current value
of that option to be printed. The \`?\&#39; is unnecessary unless the
option is Boolean valued. Boolean options are given values either by
the form \`set *option*\&#39; to turn them on or \`set no*option*\&#39; to
turn them off; string and numeric options are assigned via the form
\`set *option*=value\&#39;.

More than one parameter may be given to *set  ;* they are
interpreted left-to-right.

A list of options can be found below.

<p><strong>shell</strong> abbr: <strong>sh</strong></p>
<p>:   A new shell is created. When it terminates, editing resumes.</p>
<p><strong>source</strong> <em>file</em> abbr: <strong>so</strong></p>
<p>:   Reads and executes commands from the specified file. <em>Source</em>
    commands may be nested.</p>
<p>( <strong>.</strong> , <strong>.</strong> ) <strong>substitute</strong> /<em>pat</em> /<em>repl</em> / <em>options</em> <em>count</em>
<em>flags</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>abbr: <strong>s</strong>\</p>
<p>On each specified line, the first instance of pattern <em>pat</em> is
replaced by replacement pattern <em>repl.</em> If the <em>global</em> indicator
option character `g\' appears, then all instances are substituted; if
the <em>confirm</em> indication character `c\' appears, then before each
substitution the line to be substituted is typed with the string to be
substituted marked with `\^\' characters. By typing an `y\' one can
cause the substitution to be performed, any other input causes no
change to take place. After a <em>substitute</em> the current line is the
last line substituted.</p>
<p>Lines may be split by substituting new-line characters into them. The
newline in <em>repl</em> must be escaped by preceding it with a `\\'. Other
metacharacters available in <em>pat</em> and <em>repl</em> are described below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>stop</strong></p>
<p>:   Suspends the editor, returning control to the top level shell. If
    <em>autowrite</em> is set and there are unsaved changes, a write is done
    first unless the form <strong>stop !</strong> is used. This commands is only
    available where supported by the teletype driver, shell and
    operating system.</p>
<p>( <strong>.</strong> , <strong>.</strong> ) <strong>substitute</strong> <em>options</em> <em>count</em> <em>flags</em> abbr: <strong>s</strong></p>
<p>:   If <em>pat</em> and <em>repl</em> are omitted, then the last substitution is
    repeated. This is a synonym for the <strong>&amp;</strong> command.</p>
<p>( <strong>.</strong> , <strong>.</strong> ) <strong>t</strong> <em>addr</em> <em>flags</em></p>
<p>:   The <em>t</em> command is a synonym for <em>copy .</em></p>
<p><strong>ta</strong> <em>tag</em></p>
<p>:   The focus of editing switches to the location of <em>tag,</em> switching to
    a different line in the current file where it is defined, or if
    necessary to another file.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>The tags file is normally created by a program such as *ctags,* and
consists of a number of lines with three fields separated by blanks
or tabs. The first field gives the name of the tag, the second the
name of the file where the tag resides, and the third gives an
addressing form which can be used by the editor to find the tag;
this field is usually a contextual scan using \`/*pat*/\&#39; to be
immune to minor changes in the file. Such scans are always performed
as if *nomagic* was set.

The tag names in the tags file must be sorted alphabetically.
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>unabbreviate</strong> <em>word</em> abbr: <strong>una</strong></p>
<p>:   Delete <em>word</em> from the list of abbreviations.</p>
<p><strong>undo</strong> abbr: <strong>u</strong></p>
<p>:   Reverses the changes made in the buffer by the last buffer editing
    command. Note that <em>global</em> commands are considered a single command
    for the purpose of <em>undo</em> (as are <em>open</em> and <em>visual.)</em> Also, the
    commands <em>write</em> and <em>edit</em> which interact with the file system
    cannot be undone. <em>Undo</em> is its own inverse.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>*Undo* always marks the previous value of the current line \`**.**\&#39;

<p><strong>unmap</strong>[<strong>!</strong>] <em>lhs</em></p>
<p>:   The macro expansion associated by <em>map</em> for <em>lhs</em> is removed.</p>
<p>( 1 , \$ ) <strong>v</strong> /<em>pat</em> / <em>cmds</em></p>
<p>:   A synonym for the <em>global</em> command variant <strong>g!</strong>, running the
    specified <em>cmds</em> on each line which does not match <em>pat</em>.</p>
<p><strong>version</strong> abbr: <strong>ve</strong></p>

<p>:   Enters visual mode at the specified line. <em>Type</em> is optional and may
    be `-\' , `\^\' or `<strong>.</strong>\' as in the <em>z</em> command to specify the
    placement of the specified line on the screen. By default, if <em>type</em>
    is omitted, the specified line is placed as the first on the screen.
    A <em>count</em> specifies an initial window size; the default is the value
    of the option <em>window.</em> See the document <em>An Introduction to Display
    Editing with Vi</em> for more details. To exit this mode, type Q.</p>

<strong>visual</strong> +<em>n</em> file</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From visual mode, this command is the same as edit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>( 1 , \$ ) <strong>write</strong> <em>file</em> abbr: <strong>w</strong></p>
<p>:   Writes changes made back to <em>file</em>, printing the number of lines and
    characters written. Normally <em>file</em> is omitted and the text goes
    back where it came from. If a <em>file</em> is specified, then text will be
    written to that file. If the file does not exist it is created. The
    current file name is changed only if there is no current file name;
    the current line is never changed.</p>

<p>:   Overrides the checking of the normal <em>write</em> command, and will write
    to any file which the system permits.</p>
<p>( 1 , \$ ) <strong>w</strong> <strong>!</strong><em>command</em></p>
<p>:   Writes the specified lines into <em>command.</em> Note the difference
    between <strong>w!</strong> which overrides checks and <strong>w !</strong> which writes to a
    command.</p>
<p><strong>wq</strong> <em>name</em></p>
<p>:   Like a <em>write</em> and then a <em>quit</em> command.</p>
<p><strong>wq!</strong> <em>name</em></p>
<p>:   The variant overrides checking on the sensibility of the <em>write</em>
    command, as <strong>w!</strong> does.</p>
<p><strong>xit</strong> <em>name</em></p>
<p>:   If any changes have been made and not written to any file, writes
    the buffer out. Then, in any case, quits.</p>
<p>( <strong>.</strong> , <strong>.</strong> ) <strong>yank</strong> <em>buffer</em> <em>count</em> abbr: <strong>ya</strong></p>
<p>:   Places the specified lines in the named <em>buffer,</em> for later
    retrieval via <em>put.</em> If no buffer name is specified, the lines go to
    a more volatile place; see the <em>put</em> command description.</p>
<p>( <strong>.+1</strong> ) <strong>z</strong> <em>count</em></p>
<p>:   Print the next <em>count</em> lines, default <em>window</em>.</p>
<p>( <strong>.</strong> ) <strong>z</strong> <em>type</em> <em>count</em></p>
<p>:   Prints a window of text with the specified line at the top. If
    <em>type</em> is `-\' the line is placed at the bottom; a `<strong>.</strong>\' causes
    the line to be placed in the center. A count gives the number of
    lines to be displayed rather than double the number specified by the
    <em>scroll</em> option. On a CRT the screen is cleared before display
    begins unless a count which is less than the screen size is given.
    The current line is left at the last line printed. Forms `z=\' and
    `z\^\' also exist; `z=\' places the current line in the center,
    surrounds it with lines of `-\' characters and leaves the current
    line at this line. The form `z\^\' prints the window before `z-\'
    would. The characters `+\', `\^\' and `-\' may be repeated for
    cumulative effect.</p>
<p><strong>!</strong> <em>command</em></p>
<p>:   The remainder of the line after the `!\' character is sent to a
    shell to be executed. Within the text of <em>command</em> the characters
    `%\' and `#\' are expanded as in filenames and the character `!\'
    is replaced with the text of the previous command. Thus, in
    particular, `!!\' repeats the last such shell escape. If any such
    expansion is performed, the expanded line will be echoed. The
    current line is unchanged by this command.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>If there has been &quot;\[No write\]&quot; of the buffer contents since the

<p>( <strong>.</strong> , <strong>.</strong> ) <strong>\~</strong> <em>options</em> <em>count</em> <em>flags</em></p>
<p>:   Replaces the previous regular expression with the previous
    replacement pattern from a substitution.</p>
<h2 id="regular-expressions">Regular expressions</h2>
<p>A regular expression specifies a set of strings of characters. A member
of this set of strings is said to be <em>matched</em> by the regular
expression. <em>Ex</em> remembers two previous regular expressions: the
previous regular expression used in a <em>substitute</em> command and the
previous regular expression used elsewhere (referred to as the previous
<em>scanning</em> regular expression.) The previous regular expression can
always be referred to by a null <em>re</em>, e.g. `//\' or `??\'.</p>
<p>The following basic constructs are used to construct <em>magic</em> mode
regular expressions.</p>
<p>char</p>
<p>:   An ordinary character matches itself. The characters `<strong>\^</strong>\' at
    the beginning of a line, `<strong>\$</strong>\' at the end of line, `<strong>*</strong>\'
    as any character other than the first, `<strong>.</strong>\', `<strong>\</strong>\',
    `<strong>[</strong>\', and `<strong>\~</strong>\' are not ordinary characters and must be
    escaped (preceded) by `<strong>\</strong>\' to be treated as such.</p>
<p>\^</p>
<p>:   At the beginning of a pattern forces the match to succeed only at
    the beginning of a line.</p>
<p>\$</p>
<p>:   At the end of a regular expression forces the match to succeed only
    at the end of the line.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>:   Matches any single character except the new-line character.</p>
<p>\\&lt;</p>
<p>:   Forces the match to occur only at the beginning of a "variable" or
    "word"; that is, either at the beginning of a line, or just before a
    letter, digit, or underline and after a character not one of these.</p>
<p>\&gt;</p>
<p>:   Similar to `\\&lt;\', but matching the end of a "variable" or "word",
    i.e. either the end of the line or before character which is neither
    a letter, nor a digit, nor the underline character.</p>
<p>[string]</p>
<p>:   Matches any (single) character in the class defined by <em>string.</em>
    Most characters in <em>string</em> define themselves.\
    A pair of characters separated by `<strong>-</strong>\' in <em>string</em> defines the
    set of characters collating between the specified lower and upper
    bounds, thus `[a-z]\' as a regular expression matches any
    (single)</p>
<p>lower-case letter.\
If the sequence `<strong>[:</strong><em>class</em><strong>:]</strong>\' appears in <em>string</em>, where
class is one of `<strong>alnum</strong>\', `<strong>alpha</strong>\', `<strong>blank</strong>\',
`<strong>cntrl</strong>\', `<strong>digit</strong>\', `<strong>graph</strong>\', `<strong>lower</strong>\',
`<strong>print</strong>\', `<strong>punct</strong>\', `<strong>space</strong>\', `<strong>upper</strong>\',
`<strong>xdigit</strong>\', or a locale-specific character class, all characters
that belong to the given class are matched. Thus `[[:lower:]]\'
matches any lower-case letter, possibly including characters beyond the
scope of</p>
<p>\
If the first character of <em>string</em> is an `<strong>\^</strong>\' then the construct
matches those characters which it otherwise would not; thus
`[\^a-z]\' matches anything but an</p>
<p>lower-case letter (and of course a newline).\
Backslash `\\' is interpreted as an escape character. To place a
`\\' character in <em>string</em>, write it twice: `\\\'; to place any of
the characters `\^\', `[\', or `-\' in <em>string</em>, you escape them
with a preceding `\\'.\
Characters also lose their special meaning by position: `\^\' is an
ordinary character unless immediately following the initial `[\',
`]\' is an ordinary character if immediately following the initial
`[\' (or `\^\', if present), and `-\' is an ordinary character if
placed immediately behind `[\' or `\^\', or before \']\'.</p>
<p>The concatenation of two regular expressions matches the leftmost and
then longest string which can be divided with the first piece matching
the first regular expression and the second piece matching the second.</p>
<p>A regular expression may be enclosed between the sequences `<strong>\(</strong>\'
and `<strong>\)</strong>\', which matches whatever the enclosed expression matches.</p>
<p>Any of the (single character matching) regular expressions mentioned
above or a regular expression surrounded by `\(\' and \'\)\' may be
followed by the character `<strong>*</strong>\' to form a regular expression which
matches any number of adjacent occurrences (including 0) of characters
matched by the regular expression it follows.</p>
<p>A single character regular expression or a regular expression surrounded
by `\(\' and \'\)\' followed by `<strong>\{</strong><em>m</em><strong>,</strong><em>n</em><strong>\}</strong>\' matches
a sequence of <em>m</em> through <em>n</em> occurences, inclusive, of the single
character expression. The values of <em>m</em> and <em>n</em> must be non-negative and
smaller than 255. The form `<strong>\{</strong><em>m</em><strong>\}</strong>\' matches exactly <em>m</em>
occurences, `<strong>\{</strong><em>m</em><strong>,\}</strong>\' matches at least <em>m</em> occurences.</p>
<p>The character `<strong>\~</strong>\' may be used in a regular expression, and
matches the text which defined the replacement part of the last
<em>substitute</em> command.</p>
<p>The sequence `<strong>\</strong><em>n</em>\' matches the text that was matched by the
<em>n</em>-th regular subexpression enclosed between `\(\' and `\)\'
earlier in the expression.</p>
<h2 id="substitute-replacement-patterns">Substitute replacement patterns</h2>
<p>The basic metacharacters for the replacement pattern are `<strong>&amp;</strong>\',
`<strong>\~</strong>\', and `<strong>#</strong>\'; the first two of them are given as
`<strong>\&amp;</strong>\' and `<strong>\\~</strong>\' when <em>nomagic</em> is set. Each instance of
`<strong>&amp;</strong>\' is replaced by the characters which the regular expression
matched. The metacharacter `<strong>\~</strong>\' stands, in the replacement
pattern, for the defining text of the previous replacement pattern. If
the entire replacement pattern is `<strong>#</strong>\', the defining text of the
previous replacement pattern is used.</p>
<p>Other metasequences possible in the replacement pattern are always
introduced by the escaping character `<strong>\</strong>\'. The sequence
`<strong>\</strong><em>n</em>\' is replaced by the text matched by the <em>n</em>-th regular
subexpression enclosed between `\(\' and `\)\'. When nested,
parenthesized subexpressions are present, <em>n</em> is determined by counting
occurrences of `\(\' starting from the left. The sequences `<strong>\u</strong>\'
and `<strong>\l</strong>\' cause the immediately following character in the
replacement to be converted to upper- or lower-case respectively if this
character is a letter. The sequences `<strong>\U</strong>\' and `<strong>\L</strong>\' turn
such conversion on, either until `<strong>\E</strong>\' or `<strong>\e</strong>\' is
encountered, or until the end of the replacement pattern.</p>
<h2 id="option-descriptions">Option descriptions</h2>
<p><strong>autoindent</strong>, <strong>ai</strong> default: noai</p>
<p>:   Can be used to ease the preparation of structured program text. At
    the beginning of each <em>append ,</em> <em>change</em> or <em>insert</em> command or
    when a new line is <em>opened</em> or created by an <em>append ,</em> <em>change ,</em>
    <em>insert ,</em> or <em>substitute</em> operation within <em>open</em> or <em>visual</em> mode,
    <em>ex</em> looks at the line being appended after, the first line changed
    or the line inserted before and calculates the amount of white space
    at the start of the line. It then aligns the cursor at the level of
    indentation so determined.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>If the user then types lines of text in, they will continue to be
justified at the displayed indenting level. If more white space is
typed at the beginning of a line, the following line will start
aligned with the first non-white character of the previous line. To
back the cursor up to the preceding tab stop one can hit **\^D**.
The tab stops going backwards are defined at multiples of the
*shiftwidth* option. The user *cannot* backspace over the indent,
except by sending an end-of-file with a **\^D**.

Specially processed in this mode is a line with no characters added
to it, which turns into a completely blank line (the white space
provided for the *autoindent* is discarded.) Also specially
processed in this mode are lines beginning with an \`\^\&#39; and
immediately followed by a **\^D**. This causes the input to be
repositioned at the beginning of the line, but retaining the
previous indent for the next line. Similarly, a \`0\&#39; followed by a
**\^D** repositions at the beginning but without retaining the
previous indent.

*Autoindent* doesn\&#39;t happen in *global* commands or when the input
is not a terminal.
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>autoprint</strong>, <strong>ap</strong> default: ap</p>
<p>:   Causes the current line to be printed after each <em>delete ,</em> <em>copy ,</em>
    <em>join ,</em> <em>move ,</em> <em>substitute ,</em> <em>t ,</em> <em>undo</em> or shift command. This
    has the same effect as supplying a trailing `p\' to each such
    command. <em>Autoprint</em> is suppressed in globals, and only applies to
    the last of many commands on a line.</p>
<p><strong>autowrite</strong>, <strong>aw</strong> default: noaw</p>
<p>:   Causes the contents of the buffer to be written to the current file
    if the user has modified it and gives a <em>next,</em> <em>rewind,</em> <em>stop,</em>
    <em>tag,</em> or <em>!</em> command, or a <strong>\^\^</strong> (switch files) or <strong>\^]</strong> (tag
    goto) command in <em>visual.</em> Note, that the <em>edit</em> and <em>ex</em> commands
    do <strong>not</strong> autowrite. In each case, there is an equivalent way of
    switching when autowrite is set to avoid the <em>autowrite</em> (<em>edit</em> for
    <em>next ,</em> <em>rewind!</em> for .I rewind , <em>stop!</em> for <em>stop ,</em> <em>tag!</em> for
    <em>tag ,</em> <em>shell</em> for <em>! ,</em> and <strong>:e #</strong> and a <strong>:ta!</strong> command from
    within <em>visual).</em></p>
<p><strong>beautify</strong>, <strong>bf</strong> default: nobeautify</p>
<p>:   Causes all control characters except tab, newline and form-feed to
    be discarded from the input. A complaint is registered the first
    time a backspace character is discarded. <em>Beautify</em> does not apply
    to command input.</p>
<p><strong>directory</strong>, <strong>dir</strong> default: dir=/tmp</p>
<p>:   Specifies the directory in which <em>ex</em> places its buffer file. If
    this directory in not writable, then the editor will exit abruptly
    when it fails to be able to create its buffer there.</p>
<p><strong>edcompatible</strong> default: noedcompatible</p>
<p>:   Causes the presence of absence of <strong>g</strong> and <strong>c</strong> suffixes on
    substitute commands to be remembered, and to be toggled by repeating
    the suffices. The suffix <strong>r</strong> makes the substitution be as in the
    <em>\~</em> command, instead of like <em>&amp;.</em></p>
<p><strong>errorbells</strong>, <strong>eb</strong> default: noeb</p>
<p>:   Error messages are preceded by a bell. Bell ringing in <em>open</em> and
    <em>visual</em> on errors is not suppressed by setting <em>noeb.</em> If possible
    the editor always places the error message in a standout mode of the
    terminal (such as inverse video) instead of ringing the bell.</p>
<p><strong>exrc</strong> default: noexrc</p>
<p>:   If set, the current directory is searched for a <em>.exrc</em> file on
    startup. If this file is found, its content is treated as <em>ex</em>
    commands and executed immediately after the contents of
    <em>\$HOME/.exrc</em> on startup.</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>, <strong>fl</strong> default: flash</p>
<p>:   If the terminal provides the "visual bell" capability, ex will use
    it instead of the audible bell if <em>flash</em> is set.</p>
<p><strong>hardtabs</strong>, <strong>ht</strong> default: ht=8</p>
<p>:   Gives the boundaries on which terminal hardware tabs are set (or on
    which the system expands tabs).</p>
<p><strong>ignorecase</strong>, <strong>ic</strong> default: noic</p>
<p>:   All upper case characters in the text are mapped to lower case in
    regular expression matching. In addition, all upper case characters
    in regular expressions are mapped to lower case except in character
    class specifications.</p>
<p><strong>lisp</strong> default: nolisp</p>
<p>:   <em>Autoindent</em> indents appropriately for <em>lisp</em> code, and the <strong>( ) {
    } [[</strong> and <strong>]]</strong> commands in <em>open</em> and <em>visual</em> are modified
    to have meaning for <em>lisp</em>.</p>
<p><strong>list</strong> default: nolist</p>
<p>:   All printed lines will be displayed (more) unambiguously, showing
    tabs and end-of-lines as in the <em>list</em> command.</p>
<p><strong>magic</strong> default: magic for <em>ex</em> and <em>vi</em>, <em>Nomagic</em> for <em>edit</em>.</p>
<p>:   If <em>nomagic</em> is set, the number of regular expression metacharacters
    is greatly reduced, with only `\^\' and `\$\' having special
    effects. In addition the metacharacters `\~\' and `&amp;\' of the
    replacement pattern are treated as normal characters. All the normal
    metacharacters may be made <em>magic</em> when <em>nomagic</em> is set by
    preceding them with a `\\'.</p>
<p><strong>mesg</strong> default: mesg</p>
<p>:   Causes write permission to be turned off to the terminal while the
    user is in visual mode, if <em>nomesg</em> is set.</p>
<p><strong>modelines, ml</strong> default: nomodelines</p>
<p>:   If <em>modelines</em> is set, then the first 5 lines and the last five
    lines of the file will be checked for ex command lines and the
    comands issued. To be recognized as a command line, the line must
    have the string <strong>ex:</strong> or <strong>vi:</strong> in it. This string may be
    anywhere in the line and anything after the <em>:</em> is interpeted as
    editor commands. This option defaults to off because of unexpected
    behavior when editting files such as <em>/etc/passwd.</em></p>
<p><strong>number, nu</strong> default: nonumber</p>
<p>:   Causes all output lines to be printed with their line numbers. In
    addition each input line will be prompted for by supplying the line
    number it will have.</p>
<p><strong>open</strong> default: open</p>
<p>:   If <em>noopen</em>, the commands <em>open</em> and <em>visual</em> are not permitted.</p>
<p><strong>optimize, opt</strong> default: optimize</p>
<p>:   Throughput of text is expedited by setting the terminal to not do
    automatic carriage returns when printing more than one (logical)
    line of output, greatly speeding output on terminals without
    addressable cursors when text with leading white space is printed.</p>
<p><strong>paragraphs, para</strong> default: para=IPLPPPQPP LIbp</p>
<p>:   Specifies the paragraphs for the <strong>{</strong> and <strong>}</strong> operations in
    <em>open</em> and <em>visual.</em> The pairs of characters in the option\'s value
    are the names of the macros which start paragraphs.</p>
<p><strong>prompt</strong> default: prompt</p>
<p>:   Command mode input is prompted for with a `:\'.</p>
<p><strong>redraw</strong> default: noredraw</p>
<p>:   The editor simulates (using great amounts of output), an intelligent
    terminal on a dumb terminal (e.g. during insertions in <em>visual</em> the
    characters to the right of the cursor position are refreshed as each
    input character is typed.) Useful only at very high speed.</p>
<p><strong>remap</strong> default: remap</p>
<p>:   If on, macros are repeatedly tried until they are unchanged. For
    example, if <strong>o</strong> is mapped to <strong>O ,</strong> and <strong>O</strong> is mapped to <strong>I
    ,</strong> then if <em>remap</em> is set, <strong>o</strong> will map to <strong>I ,</strong> but if
    <em>noremap</em> is set, it will map to <strong>O .</strong></p>
<p><strong>report</strong> default: report=5, 2 for <em>edit</em>.</p>
<p>:   Specifies a threshold for feedback from commands. Any command which
    modifies more than the specified number of lines will provide
    feedback as to the scope of its changes. For commands such as
    <em>global ,</em> <em>open ,</em> <em>undo ,</em> and <em>visual</em> which have potentially
    more far reaching scope, the net change in the number of lines in
    the buffer is presented at the end of the command, subject to this
    same threshold. Thus notification is suppressed during a <em>global</em>
    command on the individual commands performed.</p>
<p><strong>scroll</strong> default: scroll=½ window</p>
<p>:   Determines the number of logical lines scrolled when an end-of-file
    is received from a terminal input in command mode, and the number of
    lines printed by a command mode <em>z</em> command (double the value of
    <em>scroll ).</em></p>
<p><strong>sections</strong> default: sections=SHNHH HU</p>
<p>:   Specifies the section macros for the <strong>[[</strong> and <strong>]]</strong>
    operations in <em>open</em> and <em>visual.</em> The pairs of characters in the
    options\'s value are the names of the macros which start paragraphs.</p>
<p><strong>shell</strong>, <strong>sh</strong> default: sh=/bin/sh</p>
<p>:   Gives the path name of the shell forked for the shell escape command
    `!\', and by the <em>shell</em> command. The default is taken from SHELL
    in the environment, if present.</p>
<p><strong>shiftwidth</strong>, <strong>sw</strong> default: sw=8</p>
<p>:   Gives the width a software tab stop, used in reverse tabbing with
    <strong>\^D</strong> when using <em>autoindent</em> to append text, and by the shift
    commands.</p>
<p><strong>showmatch, sm</strong> default: nosm</p>
<p>:   In <em>open</em> and <em>visual</em> mode, when a <strong>)</strong> or <strong>}</strong> is typed, move
    the cursor to the matching <strong>(</strong> or <strong>{</strong> for one second if this
    matching character is on the screen. Extremely useful with <em>lisp.</em></p>
<p><strong>showmode, smd</strong> default: nosmd</p>
<p>:   In <em>visual</em> mode, show a description of the current editing mode in
    the window\'s lower right corner.</p>
<p><strong>slowopen, slow</strong> terminal dependent</p>
<p>:   Affects the display algorithm used in <em>visual</em> mode, holding off
    display updating during input of new text to improve throughput when
    the terminal in use is both slow and unintelligent. See <em>An
    Introduction to Display Editing with Vi</em> for more details.</p>
<p><strong>tabstop, ts</strong> default: ts=8</p>
<p>:   The editor expands tabs in the input file to be on <em>tabstop</em>
    boundaries for the purposes of display.</p>
<p><strong>taglength, tl</strong> default: tl=0</p>
<p>:   Tags are not significant beyond this many characters. A value of
    zero (the default) means that all characters are significant.</p>
<p><strong>tags</strong> default: tags=tags /usr/lib/tags</p>
<p>:   A path of files to be used as tag files for the <em>tag</em> command. A
    requested tag is searched for in the specified files, sequentially.
    By default, files called <strong>tags</strong> are searched for in the current
    directory and in /usr/lib (a master file for the entire system).</p>
<p><strong>term</strong> from environment TERM</p>
<p>:   The terminal type of the output device.</p>
<p><strong>terse</strong> default: noterse</p>
<p>:   Shorter error diagnostics are produced for the experienced user.</p>
<p><strong>warn</strong> default: warn</p>
<p>:   Warn if there has been `[No write since last change]\' before a
    `!\' command escape.</p>
<p><strong>window</strong> default: window=speed dependent</p>
<p>:   The number of lines in a text window in the <em>visual</em> command. The
    default is 8 at slow speeds (600 baud or less), 16 at medium speed
    (1200 baud), and the full screen (minus one line) at higher speeds.</p>
<p><strong>w300, w1200, w9600</strong></p>
<p>:   These are not true options but set <strong>window</strong> only if the speed is
    slow (300), medium (1200), or high (9600), respectively. They are
    suitable for an EXINIT and make it easy to change the 8/16/full
    screen rule.</p>
<p><strong>wrapscan</strong>, <strong>ws</strong> default: ws</p>
<p>:   Searches using the regular expressions in addressing will wrap
    around past the end of the file.</p>
<p><strong>wrapmargin</strong>, <strong>wm</strong> default: wm=0</p>
<p>:   Defines a margin for automatic wrapover of text during input in
    <em>open</em> and <em>visual</em> modes. See <em>An Introduction to Text Editing with
    Vi</em> for details.</p>
<p><strong>writeany</strong>, <strong>wa</strong> default: nowa</p>

<h1 id="documentation">DOCUMENTATION</h1>
<p>The document <em>Edit: A tutorial</em> (USD:14) provides a comprehensive
introduction to <em>edit</em> assuming no previous knowledge of computers or
the</p>
<p>system.</p>
<p>The <em>Ex Reference Manual -- Version 3.7</em> (USD:16) is a comprehensive and
complete manual for the command mode features of <em>ex.</em> The</p>
<p>section of this page is taken from the manual. For an introduction to
more advanced forms of editing using the command mode of <em>ex</em> see the
editing documents written by Brian Kernighan for the editor <em>ed;</em> the
material in the introductory and advanced documents works also with
<em>ex.</em></p>
<p><em>An Introduction to Display Editing with Vi</em> (USD:15) introduces the
display editor <em>vi</em> and provides reference material on <em>vi.</em> (This
reference now forms the <em>vi</em>(1) manual page). In addition, the <em>Vi Quick
Reference</em> card summarizes the commands of <em>vi</em> in a useful, functional
way, and is useful with the <em>Introduction.</em></p>

<h1 id="author">AUTHOR</h1>
<p>Originally written by William Joy.</p>
<p>Mark Horton has maintained the editor since version 2.7, adding macros,
support for many unusual terminals, and other features such as word
abbreviation mode.</p>
<p>This version incorporates changes by Gunnar Ritter.</p>
<h1 id="notes">NOTES</h1>
<p><em>Undo</em> never clears the buffer modified condition.</p>
<p>The <em>z</em> command prints a number of logical rather than physical lines.
More than a screen full of output may result if long lines are present.</p>
<p>File input/output errors don\'t print a name if the command line
<strong>`-\'</strong> option is used.</p>
<p>The editor does not warn if text is placed in named buffers and not used
before exiting the editor.</p>
<p>Null (00) characters are converted to 0200 characters when reading input
files, and cannot appear in resultant files.</p>
<p>LC_COLLATE locales are ignored; collating symbols `[.c.]\' and
equivalence classes `[=c=]\' in bracket expressions are recognized
but useless since `c\' is restricted to a single character and is the
only character matched; range expressions `[a-m]\' are always
evaluated in byte order.</p>
